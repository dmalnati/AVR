- how to track settings when presets or MIDI changes settings
- what happens when osc1 freq == 0 and osc2 != 0?
  - balance does what?
- move files around
  - especially all peripherals/hid/etc
- analog input snap to high/low values 
- new instrument presets


Circuit
- MIDI optocoupler
- caps on power, why can I hear I2C?
- Should MIDI out->in work?
- Amp/Volume
  - is low-pass filter too aggressive?
- aux out
 
 
Physical
- wire up buttons/leds/etc
- power
- enough LEDs?
  - too bright?
- wood carve labels

 
Plan
- finalize features of box and hookups
 
 
Documentation
- take measurements of cool waveforms
- get BOM



















Functionality
-------------

Pitch Bend

Filter

SignalSource
- Add AUX In
- Add Custom Wave (drawable, loadable)

Envelope curved not linear

Make keyboard less sensitive
disable upper C
"breathe" LEDs


Performance
-----------
    
EnvelopeADSR
- appears to have a ~270us spike on transition to Release
  - due to lots of floating point math
  - fix it
  
  
  
Code Cleanup
------------

Stop using templates for SynthesizerVoice and TimerHelper

Move SignalSource files to appropriate locations (if better ones exist)

Why is there seemingly a 10us ISR wakeup?


Circuit
-------

Make own amplifier, current one has too much noise

Should midi connect from Out to In work?

Replace MIDI transistor with optocoupler.

Replace R2R ladder with pre-made.

Get AUX-out working
