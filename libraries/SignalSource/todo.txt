------

static SynthesizerVoice seems to invoke defaults after other objects
- make not-static

~45us with most functionality disabled.
  so assume really like 100us
  
! Starting with:
usPerLoop: 52
loopsPerSec: 19230
loopsPerSecWithMargin: 17307
usPerLoopWithMargin: 57

! Once FunctionGenerator non-static, and SV GetNextSample also non-static
usPerLoop: 54
loopsPerSec: 18518
loopsPerSecWithMargin: 16666
usPerLoopWithMargin: 60


! Now with SV envelope non-static
usPerLoop: 57
loopsPerSec: 17543
loopsPerSecWithMargin: 15788
usPerLoopWithMargin: 63



Functionality
-------------

Pitch Bend

SignalSource
- Add AUX In
- Add Custom Wave (drawable, loadable)

Signal to 0 when oscillators are off

Envelope curved not linear

    
Performance
-----------
    
EnvelopeADSR
- appears to have a ~270us spike on transition to Release
  - due to lots of floating point math
  - fix it

Synthesizer
- have it ask SynthesizerVoice how long a loop takes on average
  - then calculate sample rate, leaving (say) 10% headroom for other CPU work
  - make sure TimerHelper configurable to be "less than" requested instead of
    simply "closest to"

  
  
  
  
Code Cleanup
------------

Stop using templates for SynthesizerVoice and TimerHelper

Would using anonymous unions speed up FixedPoint?




Circuit
-------

Make own amplifier, current one has too much noise
