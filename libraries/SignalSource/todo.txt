-------------

Pitch Bend

Filter

SignalSource
- Add AUX In
- Add Custom Wave (drawable, loadable)

Envelope curved not linear



Performance
-----------
    
EnvelopeADSR
- appears to have a ~270us spike on transition to Release
  - due to lots of floating point math
  - fix it
  
  
  
Code Cleanup
------------

Stop using templates for SynthesizerVoice and TimerHelper

Move SignalSource files to appropriate locations (if better ones exist)

Why is there seemingly a 10us ISR wakeup?


Circuit
-------

Make own amplifier, current one has too much noise

Should midi connect from Out to In work?

Replace MIDI transistor with optocoupler.

Replace R2R ladder with pre-made.

Get AUX-in working
