Performance
-----------
    
EnvelopeADSR
- appears to have a ~270us spike on transition to Release
  - due to lots of floating point math
  - fix it

Synthesizer
- have it ask SynthesizerVoice how long a loop takes on average
  - then calculate sample rate, leaving (say) 10% headroom for other CPU work
  - make sure TimerHelper configurable to be "less than" requested instead of
    simply "closest to"

  
  
  
  
Code Cleanup
------------

Stop using templates for SynthesizerVoice and TimerHelper
